        <h2>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESITONS</h2>

        <div id="QA">
          <ul>
            <li>Do I need to buy a plug adapter for my electronics?</li>
            <li>
              Power outlets are 120 volts (the same as in the United States).
            </li>
            <li>Is there a language barrier?</li>
            <li>
              Many younger Tanitians speak fluent English. Very little English
              is spoken in rural areas, especially by the older residents.
            </li>
            <li>What is the currency on the island?</li>
            <li>
              Taniti uses the U.S. dollar as its currency, but many businesses
              will also accept euros and yen. Several banks facilitate currency
              exchange, and many businesses accept major credit cards.
            </li>
            <li>Is there a legal drinking age?</li>
            <li>
              Alcohol is not allowed to be served or sold between the hours of
              midnight and 9:00 a.m. The drinking age on Taniti is 18 and the
              drinking age is not strictly enforced.
            </li>
            <li>If I need medical attention, what are my options?</li>
            <li>
              There is one hospital and several clinics. The hospital has many
              multilingual employees.
            </li>
            <li>What is crime like on the island?</li>
            <li>
              Violent crime is very rare on Taniti, but as tourism increases,
              there are more reports of pickpocketing and other petty crimes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Does Taniit have holidays I should be aware of for closings?
            </li>
            <li>
              Taniti enjoys a large number of national holidays, and many
              tourist attractions and restaurants will be closed on holidays, so
              visitors should plan accordingly.
